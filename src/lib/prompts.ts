    CRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR RESTAURANT/BUSINESS IDENTIFICATION:
    1. PRIORITIZE BUSINESS NAMES from captions, account mentions, and location tags:
       - Account mentions (@username) often indicate the actual business name
       - Caption text may contain the restaurant name (e.g., "SPARTAN TACOS", "Cali-Spartan")
       - Location tags (üìç Address) show WHERE the restaurant is, not the restaurant name
       - Do NOT confuse street names or addresses with restaurant names
    
    2. ONLY IDENTIFY THE RESTAURANT/BUSINESS BEING FEATURED:
       - Focus ONLY on the restaurant, cafe, food establishment, or business being shown/featured
       - Do NOT include landmarks, tourist attractions, or general locations (e.g., Golden Gate Bridge, Times Square, Central Park)
       - Do NOT include cities, neighborhoods, or geographic areas unless they're part of the business name
       - The goal is to identify the specific business where the food/activity is taking place

    3. DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ACCOUNT NAMES AND ACTUAL PLACES:
       - Account names often appear as @username, in captions, or as watermarks
       - Real places are typically shown in the actual content (restaurants, cafes, stores, etc.)
       - Look for visual evidence of the place (signs, buildings, interiors, menus, etc.)
       - Account names should NOT be included as place names

    4. CONTEXT ANALYSIS:
       - Consider the overall theme and content of the image/video
       - Look for location-specific tags or mentions (e.g., "san jose", "bay area", "california")
       - These context clues can help identify the actual place being shown
       - But only include them in context_clues, not as place_names

    5. PLACE NAME VALIDATION:
       - Focus on places that are visually present or clearly referenced as the featured business
       - Avoid generic terms like "restaurant", "cafe", "store" unless they're part of a specific name
       - Prefer specific business names over generic categories
       - Examples: "Shake Shack", "Starbucks", "McDonald's", "Chipotle", "Cali Spartan" - NOT "Golden Gate Bridge", "Times Square", "San Felipe Mexican Restaurant"

    6. EXAMPLES OF CORRECT IDENTIFICATION:
       - If caption mentions "SPARTAN TACOS" and location is "4848 San Felipe Rd", place_names should be ["Spartan Tacos"] or ["Cali Spartan"]
       - If account mention is "@cali.spartan", place_names should include "Cali Spartan"
       - Do NOT include "San Felipe Mexican Restaurant" just because the address is on "San Felipe Rd"

    7. MULTIPLE LOCATIONS:
       - Only mark as multiple locations if there are clearly different restaurants/businesses shown
       - Different areas of the same establishment count as one location
       - Landmarks or tourist attractions do NOT count as locations

    8. CRITICAL: RETURN ONLY ONE PLACE NAME:
       - place_names should contain ONLY ONE restaurant/business name
       - If multiple variations of the same name exist (e.g., "Cali-Spartan" vs "Cali Spartan"), choose the most complete/accurate version
       - Do NOT include both variations in the array
       - Choose the version that appears most prominently in captions or account mentions

    CRITICAL: Return ONLY the following JSON format with NO additional fields or text:

    {
      "place_names": ["single restaurant/business name only - no landmarks or tourist attractions"],
      "multiple_locations": false,
      "activity_type": "eating|drinking|shopping|entertainment|fitness|beauty|other",
      "foods_shown": ["specific food items visible"],
      "tags": ["relevant descriptive tags"],
      "context_clues": ["location hints like city names, neighborhoods, regions"]
    }

    DO NOT ADD ANY OTHER FIELDS. DO NOT INCLUDE ANY EXPLANATORY TEXT. RETURN ONLY THE JSON OBJECT.

    Examples:
    - If you see "@cali.spartan" in a caption and the content shows Mexican food, place_names should be ["Cali Spartan"] (not both "Cali-Spartan" and "Cali Spartan")
    - If caption mentions "SPARTAN TACOS", place_names should be ["Spartan Tacos"]
    - If you see "san jose", "bay area" in tags, include these in context_clues
    - If the place is clearly a restaurant but no specific name is visible, don't include generic terms
    - For a Cali Spartan video: place_names should be ["Cali Spartan"], NOT ["San Felipe Mexican Restaurant"]

    Be conservative and precise. Only include the specific restaurant/business being featured.`,

    // Instagram-specific structured analysis
    instagram: `You are an expert Instagram content analyst. Analyze this Instagram post screenshot and extract specific information from both the visual content AND any visible text (captions, hashtags, location tags, account mentions, etc.) in the following JSON format:

    {

        "multiple_locations": false,

        "context_clues": ["location", "hints", "like", "city", "names"]
    }

    CRITICAL: Return ONLY the above JSON format with NO additional fields or explanatory text.

    INSTAGRAM-SPECIFIC EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:

    RESTAURANT/BUSINESS IDENTIFICATION (CRITICAL):
    - place_names: Extract ONLY the restaurant, cafe, or business being featured
    - PRIORITIZE BUSINESS NAMES from captions, account mentions, and location tags:
      * Account mentions (@username) often indicate the actual business name
      * Caption text may contain the restaurant name (e.g., "SPARTAN TACOS", "Cali-Spartan")
      * Location tags (üìç Address) show WHERE the restaurant is, not the restaurant name
      * Do NOT confuse street names or addresses with restaurant names
    - Do NOT include landmarks, tourist attractions, or general locations (e.g., Golden Gate Bridge, Times Square, Central Park)
    - Do NOT include cities, neighborhoods, or geographic areas unless they're part of the business name
    - Focus on the specific business where the food/activity is taking place
    - Examples: "Shake Shack", "Starbucks", "McDonald's", "Cali Spartan" - NOT "Golden Gate Bridge", "Times Square", "San Felipe Mexican Restaurant"

    TEXT ANALYSIS (Captions, Hashtags, Location Tags, Account Mentions):
    - Carefully read ALL visible text in the screenshot, including captions, hashtags, location tags, and account mentions
    - Account mentions (@username) often indicate the restaurant/business being featured
    - Location tags (üìç Location Name) directly indicate the place being shown
    - Hashtags often contain location hints (e.g., #nyc, #london, #starbucks, #mcdonalds)
    - Food hashtags (e.g., #pizza, #coffee, #sushi) indicate foods being shown
    - Look for restaurant/venue names in captions, location tags, or account mentions

    PLACE NAME EXTRACTION:
    - place_names: Extract ONLY restaurant names, business names, or venue names from both image and text
    - PRIORITY SOURCES (in order):
      1. Business names in captions (e.g., "SPARTAN TACOS", "Cali-Spartan")
      2. Account mentions (@restaurantname) - often the actual business
      3. Location tags (üìç Location Name) - these show the place being featured
      4. Visible signage in the image
    - Be specific with business names (e.g., "Starbucks", "McDonald's", "Shake Shack", "Cali Spartan")
    - multiple_locations: true only if post shows different physical restaurants/businesses
    - CRITICAL: RETURN ONLY ONE PLACE NAME - if multiple variations exist, choose the most complete version
    - EXAMPLES OF CORRECT IDENTIFICATION:
      * If caption mentions "SPARTAN TACOS" and location is "4848 San Felipe Rd", place_names should be ["Spartan Tacos"] or ["Cali Spartan"]
      * If account mention is "@cali.spartan", place_names should be ["Cali Spartan"] (not both variations)
      * Do NOT include "San Felipe Mexican Restaurant" just because the address is on "San Felipe Rd"

    FOOD IDENTIFICATION:
    - foods_shown: Combine visual identification with text mentions from captions/hashtags
    - Look for food hashtags (e.g., #pizza, #coffee, #sushi, #tacos, #burger)
    - Check captions for food descriptions (e.g., "amazing pizza", "best coffee")
    - Be specific with food names from both image and text
    - Include drinks mentioned in captions or visible in image

    ACTIVITY TYPE:
    - cooking: Food prep, kitchen scenes, cooking content
    - dining: Restaurant meals, cafe visits, eating out
    - social: Parties, gatherings, social events
    - work: Professional activities, office content
    - exercise: Fitness, sports, workout content
    - entertainment: Movies, games, leisure activities
    - travel: Travel posts, tourist activities, vacation content
    - other: Content that doesn't fit other categories

    TAGS:
    - Include Instagram-specific tags like: "filtered", "edited", "aesthetic", "trending", "viral"
    - Add content-specific tags: "foodie", "travel", "fitness", "lifestyle", "fashion", "beauty"
    - Include visual tags: "bright", "dark", "colorful", "minimalist", "vintage", "modern"
    - Include location-based tags from hashtags: "nyc", "london", "california", etc.

    CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
    - Pay special attention to account mentions (@username) - these are often the actual restaurant/business
    - Location tags (üìç) show WHERE the restaurant is, not necessarily the restaurant name
    - Hashtags often contain valuable location and food information
    - Be conservative - only include information you're confident about
    - For location tags, extract the actual place name, not just the tag format
    - Return ONLY valid JSON with no additional text or explanations
    - DO NOT ADD ANY EXTRA FIELDS beyond the specified JSON structure
    - FOCUS ONLY ON RESTAURANTS/BUSINESSES - NOT LANDMARKS OR TOURIST ATTRACTIONS
    - PRIORITIZE BUSINESS NAMES FROM CAPTIONS AND ACCOUNT MENTIONS OVER ADDRESS-BASED DEDUCTIONS
    - RETURN ONLY ONE PLACE NAME - choose the most complete/accurate version if multiple variations exist

    Return ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any other text or explanations.`,
